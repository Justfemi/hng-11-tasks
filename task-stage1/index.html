      <h2>My Tech Goals</h2>
    </div>
    
    <div class="details">
      <p>
        As a newcomer to frontend development with foundational knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, 
        and ReactJS, my primary goal over the next two years is to deepen my understanding of these core technologies 
        and build a robust portfolio. I aim to master advanced JavaScript concepts and ReactJS features, including 
        hooks, context API, and state management with Redux or Context API. Additionally, I plan to become proficient 
        in Tailwind CSS, leveraging its utility-first approach to design responsive and aesthetically pleasing user 
        efficiently. By the end of this period, I intend to have developed several comprehensive projects that 
        demonstrate my ability to create dynamic and visually appealing web applications, which will serve as a 
        testament to my skills and a stepping stone for career opportunities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Furthermore, I aim to expand my skill set by exploring complementary technologies and tools that enhance the 
        development workflow and project scalability. This includes gaining experience with version control systems 
        like Git, understanding the principles of CI/CD pipelines, and learning about testing frameworks such as 
        Jest or Cypress to ensure code quality. I also plan to familiarize myself with backend technologies, such as 
        Node.js and Express, to build full-stack applications and understand the complete web development lifecycle. 
        Participation in open-source projects and continuous learning through online courses, coding bootcamps, and 
        developer communities will be integral to my growth. By the end of these two years, my goal is to transition 
        from a novice to a proficient frontend developer, equipped with a versatile skill set and ready to tackle more 
        complex projects and roles in the tech industry.
